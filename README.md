## Introduction

This project was done as part of the Computer Graphics discipline taught in the second semester of 2024 by the professor Jean Roberto Ponciano. 

In this code, a 3D scene was implemented using some graphic tools, such as GLFW to manage windows and OpenGL to handle the graphic computing. Our main goal was to create a landscape using 5 composed objects (combination of primitives - pyramid, cube, sphere, etc) and to move some of them using the keyboard to add geometric transformations.
